# **Hyperbolic Tiling Generator**

**Type:** Algorithm / Visualisation Tool · **Tech Stack:** Python, Geometry, Computational Graphics · **Year:** 2025

## **Overview**

This project explores efficient methods for generating hyperbolic tessellations within the [Poincaré disk model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_disk_model). The work originated during development of **Tordie 3–5** and related computer science coursework focused on geometric computation. This site is [live](https://moae.dev/comp3821-project/)!

## **Details**

The generator implements an algorithm designed to span the Poincaré disk as efficiently as possible. It serves as both a visualisation tool and an experimental foundation for more complex geometric systems used in later projects.

For a deeper look at the manual generation process, see my [workflow on efficient hyperbolic tessellation](https://moae.dev/workflows/#/mathematics/analytic_geometry/Efficient-Tiling-of-a-Hyperbolic-Tessellation).

## **Note**

This implementation may differ from the version used in **Tordie**, which should be consulted separately for production details.
