# Hyperbolic Tiling Generator

I've found myself working on hyperbolic tessellations during the development of Tordie 3, 4 and 5, as well as a few projects during my studies of computer science. One such project involved finding an optimal algorithm to span the [Poincar√© disk model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_disk_model) as efficiently as possible.

If you want to know more about how to generate this manually, then you may find [this Workflow](https://moae.dev/workflows/#/mathematics/analytic_geometry/Efficient-Tiling-of-a-Hyperbolic-Tessellation) interesting to see.

Please note that this algorithm may not be optimal, and may not be the exact implementation used in Tordie. Please be sure to consult to Tordie implementation separately if this is of interest.
